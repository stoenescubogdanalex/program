# Courses

Our program is split into multiple phases from the pre-course, foundation and later the specialism courses which offer multiple paths to progress through.

It's important to note that this documentation lists all of the courses that we have developed. We do not always run every course for every team listed below. To see which courses are active and open for applications, see our website for up to date information [hackyourfuture.dk](https://hackyourfuture.dk).
