## Module Learning Goals

> [!TIP]
> Learning goals should be a list of outcomes, rather than a list of topics. For example, instead of "Synchronous vs Asynchronous", write something like "Explain the difference between sync and async code execution in JavaScript"

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- [ ] `[action verb] [specific skill/knowledge]`

## Prerequisites

> [!TIP]
> Some modules build on the learning goals of other modules. If that is the case, link them below. If there are no prerequesites, feel free to remove this section.

You should have completed or understand the learning goals in the following modules before proceeding:
