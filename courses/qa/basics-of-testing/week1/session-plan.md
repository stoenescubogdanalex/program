# Session Plan

> Session duration: 2–2.5 hours
> Session overview
> In this session, we will introduce the fundamentals of software testing and quality assurance.

This session focuses on concepts and mindset, not tools or automation.

## Session Materials

> [!TIP]
> Previously used slides, docs or any other materials that future mentors could get value from should be listed here. If we don't have any (yet), this section can be removed.

These are some examples of previously created materials by mentors that you can use yourself, or for inspiration.

- [`Resource Name`, `@author`, `Team X`](https://example.com/)

## Session Outline

> [!TIP]
> Write a plan for the order of topics, points to cover, examples, timings, exercises and any other useful info to guide the session.

## Exercises

> [!TIP]
> Exercises might appear inside the Session Outline section if they are tightly integrated into the flow of the session. If you have more like a library of exercises that should be worked through in order, then you could also list them in a separate section here.

## Optional Exercises

> [!TIP]
> If you have some extra exercises that trainees can complete if they finish the rest, or want to push themselves, include them in this optional section.
