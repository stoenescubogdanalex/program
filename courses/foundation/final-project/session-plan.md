# Session Plan

## Session Outline

This module is designed to be ran as a three week project. That means there will be three sessions, but it doesn't have the usual structure of content and learning goals for each week.

Instead, trainees will be continuously working through the [Project Brief](project-brief.md), which is split up into three weekly milestones.

### The first session

Note: Trainees will work in pairs to compelete the project. These pairs will have been organised by a staff member before the session.

- Introduce the project requirements outlined in the [Readme](README.md) and answer any questions.
- Remind trainees to use the project management skills they have recently learned. The [Readme](README.md) describes these "organisational requirements" of the project that must be met.
- Give space for the trainees to organise into their pairs and get started.
- Actively work your way around the pairs, making sure everyone is making progress as they should.
- If multiple people are facing similar challenges, take the opportunity to "pause" the session and walk through something together out loud (e.g. creating a new github repo).

### The following sessions

- Progress update: Check in on what people have completed since last week, what they found hard, questions to answer, and encourage some people to demo their progress in front of the team.
- Teaching moment: If there were any significant issues or confusions that came up, spend some time diving into them in detail.
- Introduce the next milestone: Talk through the next requirements in detail, and answer any questions.
- Pairing time: Allow space for the trainees to continue working on their project, answering any questions as they come up with the whole team.

### The final session

The final session acts as a showcase for the projects. Here is an outline that can be shared with trainees:

```plaintext
🎮 Final Project Presentation Guidelines
When: 3rd week of the Foundation project
Duration: 7–10 minutes per team

Presentation structure:

1. Start with your Trello board → Explain your workflow, task organization, and process.

2. Show your project → Demonstrate the working game/application.

3. Talk about contributions → Each team member should briefly explain what they worked on.

Requirements before presentation day:
✅ Project must be fully deployed and live.
✅ Prepare a QR code linking to your live project.

During the session:

Share the QR code so other teams can test your game on their devices.
```
