# Session Plan

## Session Goal

Equip trainees with a realistic understanding of the job search process and what is expected beyond technical proficiency. Clarify how HYF can support them, and where its boundaries lie. Set the foundation for professional self-presentation and awareness of the Danish job market structure.

Guide trainees to understand how their CV and LinkedIn profile should work in harmony to present a complete and professional image to recruiters. Provide tools, examples, and hands-on practice in critiquing and improving their online presence.

## Your Preparation (Before Session)

### 1. Familiarize Yourself with Materials

Thoroughly read the [same preparation](preparation.md) as the trainees.

### 2. Review Responses to the "Career Status" Survey

Before the session, check submissions in the team Slack channel or [survey tool](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1paMG5mM5FfpXHvRYnz4FLFHhGJF6xwKgfztY2Kw90CY/edit).

Use these responses to:

- Tailor examples to trainees situations
- Identify trainees needing more support
- Initiate relevant 1-on-1 conversations

### 3. Prepare Slide Deck

Include:

1. Summary of key soft vs. hard skills
1. Overview of Danish employment structures (Union, A-Kasse, Contracts)
1. Highlights and characteristics of Danish workplace culture and society.
1. [Slide deck example can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sYaWbvFmylrLv5AnWPsL4dbuj6Ifl1ufwTGJeqWXZqY/edit?usp=drive_link).

### 4. Set Expectations Clearly

Be ready to clarify:

- What HYF can support (mentorship, feedback, referrals, skill-building)
- What HYF cannot do (guarantee job placement, write applications for trainees, legal employment advice)
