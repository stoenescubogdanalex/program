1. Prepare questions for the interview: At the end of the interview, asking thoughtful questions demonstrates interest, engagement and can make a great impression. Prepare your own list of questions. Use this examples for inspiration, if needed:
   - Based on our discussion, what value do you feel I could bring to the team?
   - Are there any gaps in my experience that you are concerned about?
   - What are the next steps and when should I be expecting to hear from you?
   - What is the tech stack of your company?
   - What do the internal processes at your company look like? (workflow, growth plan, onboarding plan)
   - What is the team composition? (the team you are interviewing for)
   - What is the most important trait of the position?
   - Questions that matter to you (depends on your personal circumstances, maybe you would like to work remotely, maybe you would like to have a mentor, etc.)
