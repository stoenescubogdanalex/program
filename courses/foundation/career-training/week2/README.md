# Career Training (Week 2)

This session is for practicing for a screening interview and receiving feedback from peers and volunteers.

You've made a lot of progress on your CVs and LinkedIn profiles so far, and now you get the opportunity to practice a screening interview. Watch out in your teams' slack channel, where you will receive a case to prepare for.

We will also bring a camera so that you can get updated photos for your LinkedIn and CV - so wear the clothing you would like to have on your professional profile!
