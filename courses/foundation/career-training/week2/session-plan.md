# Session Plan

This session is focused on realistic screening interviews, peer feedback, and volunteer involvement. Trainees present themselves with an elevator pitch, and give answers based on a case that they’ve been preparing for over the prior 2.5 days.

## Session Goal

Create a realistic but supportive interview environment where trainees can:

1. Practice giving their elevator pitch clearly and confidently
1. Gain actionable feedback on both technical and soft skills
1. Improve their readiness for real interviews

Key message to reinforce: “It’s not about having the perfect experience - it’s about clearly explaining your skills, competencies and potential in the role.”

## Session Outline

A screening interview serves as an initial assessment that helps employers determine whether a candidate possesses the foundational skills, professional disposition, and communication abilities required for further consideration in the hiring process. It allows interviewers to verify key qualifications, explore general behavioral tendencies, and gauge overall alignment with the role and organizational culture. This early conversation streamlines the selection process by identifying strong potential matches while ensuring that subsequent stages focus on candidates who demonstrate both capability and suitability.

## During the Interview

1. Observe how clearly the candidate explains past experiences and technical concepts
1. Note whether responses are structured, coherent, and appropriately detailed
1. Assess the candidate’s ability to stay focused on the question without unnecessary distractions
1. Evaluate the candidate’s listening skills and how accurately they respond to prompts
1. Consider the candidate’s level of professionalism in tone, pace, and choice of language
1. Watch for signs of confidence and composure when addressing unfamiliar or challenging questions
1. Assess how well the candidate adapts explanations for different audiences and levels of expertise
