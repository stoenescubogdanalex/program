# Assignment

Now it's time to practice planning a project and prioritising tasks on your own!

## Instructions

1. Imagine you are building a new personal portfolio website. Think about the kinds of set up, features, content etc. that would be required to bring it to life.

2. Create a new Trello board using [the same columns as you did in the session exercise](./session-plan.md#prioritising-tasks) and brainstorm a list of at least 10 tasks to implement the projet.

3. Prioritise each task into the **Now**, **Next** and **Later** columns and order the tasks accordingly.

## Tips

- You're only _planning_ a project here, so expect the "In Progress" and "Done" columns to be empty for now.
- There's no right answer for e.g. how many tasks you prioritise into the first sprint, but check out these guiding tips to stay on the right track:
  **Now** - Tasks to complete in the first sprint (e.g. first week). These will likely be set up tasks and end in the first working version of your portfolio.
  **Next** - Tasks to complete in the next sprint (e.g. next week). These will likely be adding/finishing the main features of your portfolio.
  **Later** - Tasks to be prioritised at a later date (e.g. some time in the future). These could be optional ideas, improvements or new features to explore later.

## Submission

Submit your assignment as a PR as usual. Add your board's public link to a simple text or markdown file.
