Open a new SQL script to write your queries in.

When running queries it is important to remember few things:
![Run your queries](dbeaver-screenshots/run%20queries.png)

1. Orange triangle will only **run the selected query**.
2. Little document with triangle will **run the entire script file**.
3. **Query is selected** when it is **manually selected** or **the cursor is standing on the query**.
4. **Always remember to end queries with semi-colon**: `;`! Otherwise the edit does not know when query ends!

## Errors will be marked

In case of errors, DBMS will mark them red. If you hover on the error, **DBMS will tell you the exact issue with your query**!

## Saving queries for homework

When done with queries, save them to your homework repo using this "Save As" like from any other software. Remember the `.sql` extention!
