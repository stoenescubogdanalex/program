# Session Plan

- Recap of js basics
  - Variables
  - Types
  - Conditionals
  - Functions
  - For loop
  - scope
  - Arrays
  - Objects
  - Ask the trainees what they need to get repeated. Or figure it out by doing some code example.
- Solving problems
  - <https://dev.to/aprietof/5-steps-to-solving-programming-problems--502d>
- [Code inspiration](#fibonacci-sequence)
- [Exercises](#exercises)

This session is about getting the basics hammered down. We have had a lot of trainees who think the js module is too difficult. That is why this session is here, to ease the steepness of the js learning curve.

Focus on

- Recapping what the trainees struggle with
- Letting the trainees learn a framework for solving problems
- Lots and lost of exercises 💪

## Typical misconceptions

- Difference between return and console.log
- What console.log does and what it is made for

## Code inspiration

### Fibonacci Sequence

Given a specific position in the Fibonacci sequence, return the Fibonacci number.

```js
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

fib(5); // 3
fib(10); // 34
```

Try not to just solve the problem, but explain what you are doing and thinking!

Try using this as a framework for solving the problem: <https://dev.to/aprietof/5-steps-to-solving-programming-problems--502d>

## Exercises

### Fizz buzz

This is a classic programming task.

Create a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

When that works. Make the two number for multiples into parameters. So it can be called like this:

`fizzBuzz(4, 12);`

### Build a sentiment analyser

A sentiment analyser is some functionality that figures out how positive/negative a sentence is.

For example, the sentence `I am mega super awesome happy" Should have a high score
The sentence "I hate doing boring stuff" should have a low score.

Create a function that takes a string as a parameter. calling the function will return an object with `score`, `positiveWords` and `negativeWords`. You decide how the score should be implemented and what words are negative and positive.

Here is an example of using the function:

```js
const sentimentScoreObject = getSentimentScore("I am mega super awesome happy");

console.log(sentimentScoreObject);
/*
{
  score: 3,
  positiveWords: ['happy', 'awesome', 'super'],
  negativeWords: [],
}
*/
```

### Credit card number formatter

This is a very real world example of a problem I got at my previous work. I
was tasked to implement one of the smart credit card input fields, where the
credit card numbers are separated with a space. e.g. inputting 123456789 would show 1234 5678 9.

![Credit card formatter](assets/credit-card-formatter.gif)

Create a function that takes a number as parameter. The function should return the following object:

```js
const formattedCreditCardObject = formatCreditCardNumber(123456789);
console.log(formattedCreditCardObject);
/*
{
  original: 123456789,
  formatted: "1234 5678 9",
}
*/
```

Thins to consider:

- What should happen if the function is called with an argument that is not a number?

### Character frequencies

Write a function that counts the frequency of characters in a string:

```js
console.log(getCharacterFrequencies("happy"));
/*
{
  h: 1,
  a: 1,
  p: 2,
  y: 1
}
*/
```

The expected output above allows for a relatively simple solution mechanism. Hint: Think about using object property accessors.
For a bigger challenge, you can try to write the same function for a different expected output as seen below. It will require implementing some additional logic.

```js
/*
{
  characters: [
    {
      character: 'a',
      count: 1
    },
    {
      character: 'h',
      count: 1
    },
    {
      character: 'p',
      count: 2
    },
    {
      character: 'y',
      count: 1
    }
  ], length: 5
}
*/
```

### Palindromic substring

Write a function that finds the longest palindromic substring of a given string.

### Credit card info

Similar to the format credit card number, now we need to identify the credit card type.

```js
console.log(getCardInfo(4781321334789876)); // 'visa'
```

How can we find out what rules there are for credit cards? Programmers best friend is always available :)

### Tic Tac Toe

Draw a tic tac toe game.

Write a function called `getRenderedGame(position)` that takes `position` as parameter. `position` is a two dimensional array that shows the position of a game.

Here is an example:

With the following two dimensional array

```js
const position = [
  ["x", "o", " "],
  [" ", "o", " "],
  [" ", "o", "x"],
];

const renderedGame = getRenderedGame(position);
console.log(renderedGame);

/*
 *******
 *x*o* *
 * *o* *
 * *o*x*
 *******
 */
```

Create a new function called `getGameInfo(position)`. Calling the function should return an object with `winner` key, `loser` key, `hasEnded` and `nextPlayer`.

EXAMPLES!!!!

```js
const position = [
  ["x", "o", " "],
  [" ", "o", " "],
  [" ", "o", "x"],
];

const gameInfo = getGameInfo(position);
console.log(gameInfo);

/*
{
  winner: 'o',
  loser: 'x',
  hasEnded: true
}
*/
```

```js
const position = [
  ["x", "o", " "],
  [" ", " ", " "],
  [" ", "o", "x"],
];

const gameInfo = getGameInfo(position);
console.log(gameInfo);

/*
{
  winner: undefined,
  loser: undefined,
  hasEnded: false
}
*/
```

Try and make the game playable! _optional_
