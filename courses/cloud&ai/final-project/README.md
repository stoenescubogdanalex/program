# Final Project

The capstone project for the Cloud & AI specialization consists of two required projects that demonstrate mastery of cloud deployment and AI/ML integration using AWS services.

## Project Requirements

Trainees must complete **BOTH** of the following projects:

| Week   | Projects                          |
