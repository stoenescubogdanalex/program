# Frontend Requirements

This document describes all requirements that you _must_ complete as part of finishing your project. You are strongly encouraged to implement your own ideas to showcase the range of your technical abilities - now is the time to push yourself! Don't forget to implement the requirements below, first, though.

## Product Requirements

Users must be able to:

- [ ] Easily understand the purpose of the app and who it's for
- [ ] Experience a consistent design throughout the app
- [ ] Sign up and log in
- [ ] Navigate between and use 3 (or more) distinct screens/pages
- [ ] View dynamic data/content (e.g. from an external API)
- [ ] Input, modify and submit persistent data (e.g. that saves across sessions)
- [ ] Receive feedback on their actions (e.g. loading, button clicks, input validation)
- [ ] Recover gracefully in the case of issues (e.g. missing data, api errors, invalid forms)
- [ ] Use the application on both desktop and mobile

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] User mangement
  - [ ] Basic access control (e.g. logged in and logged out users have appropriate access)
  - [ ] Session management (e.g. to maintain user state during their use of the app)

- [ ] Data
  - [ ] Use 1 (or more) external APIs to support your apps dynamic features
  - [ ] Store appropriate data persistently (e.g. via an API and/or local storage)

- [ ] Security and error handling
  - [ ] Input sanitisation - Ensure all user input is cleaned to prevent security vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Form validation - Validate user input to make sure they fit appropriate criteria (e.g. strong passwords)
  - [ ] Error handling - Sufficient handling of issues and errors to avoid the app breaking

- [ ] Architecture
  - [ ] Component-based architecture
  - [ ] Handle routing of multiple pages with React Router

- [ ] UX and Design
  - [ ] Responsive design (e.g. a layout that adapts to different screen sizes graciously)
  - [ ] Consistent styling approach (e.g. component-specific styles, CSS modules)
  - [ ] Basic accessibility (e.g. semantic HTML, alt-text, keyboard navigation on forms)

## Organisational Requirements

- [ ] Work as a team of 4-5 trainees to complete the project together
- [ ] Assign clear roles and/or areas of ownership between each team member
- [ ] Use Trello to organise your project tasks and visualise your progress
- [ ] Define all of your tasks clearly using Trello cards
- [ ] Organise your team using weekly sprints
- [ ] Run weekly planning sessions to decide on the next tasks and priority order for the sprint
- [ ] Submit small pull request(s) for each task, ready to be reviewed by other team members before merging

## Deliverables

To submit your finished project, you will need:

- [ ] A deployed and working app accessible via the browser with a public URL
- [ ] Code versioned using git along with meaningful commit messages
- [ ] Code pushed to a public GitHub repo on your profile
- [ ] A README in the root of your repo including:
  - [ ] A project description
  - [ ] How to run it locally
  - [ ] A link to your deployed app
  - [ ] Key technical summary & decisions
  - [ ] Known limitations & future improvements
