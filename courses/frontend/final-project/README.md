# Final Project (Frontend)

This module contains information about the final module of the program, where you will take everything you have learned so far and work together as a team to build a final project together.

This module usually runs for 4-5 weeks.

The final project can be organised differently, depending on the team responsible, mentors and the opportunities available at the time. The default option is to run it with:

1. Trainee-proposed projects (e.g. [example project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1558NnZ0Fuwol-UhZIo9YcxxO1UtI7vJOWYgkBmF2EPc/edit)) and built using [HYF Project Template](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-project-template)

Alternatively, when possible, we can run them as:

2. Client-driven projects designed in collaboration with a real client partner, built using their own templates and starting codebase.

## Learning Goals

These goals are required regardless of how the final project is organised.

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- [ ] Collaborate effectively in a team setting
  - [ ] Read and extend/improve other peoples code
  - [ ] Give and receive constructive PR feedback
  - [ ] Plan, communicate and coordinate technical tasks / solutions upfront before implementation
- [ ] Develop self-guided learning skills (e.g. learn to read documetation for a new tool or API)
- [ ] Interpret a problem statement and specs/wireframes/prototypes into buildable requirements
- [ ] Break down bigger problems into smaller, actionable written tasks
- [ ] Work in iterative sprints and achieve deadlines
- [ ] Ask for help effectively and at the right time (e.g. describing problems to mentors, asking online, and knowing the power _and_ limitations of using AI)
- [ ] Deploy a completed project you are proud to showcase on your portfolio
