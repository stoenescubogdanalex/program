# Assignment
There is no individual assignment for this module.
Instead, the concepts practiced during the session are expected to be applied directly in your Final Project.

## Instructions



During the Final Project, your team should:
- **Define your MVP** and document it clearly in a place where your mentor can review it.
- **Set up a shared board** and break the project into well-structured tasks.
- **Agree on your code review process** (how reviews are done, how many reviewers are required) and actively follow it throughout the project.
- **Use daily communication** and planning habits practiced during the workshop to coordinate work and handle blockers.

Your mentors will evaluate how effectively your team worked together, how you applied Agile principles, and how well you managed your process from planning to delivery.
