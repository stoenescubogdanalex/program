# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof). We expect all in the HackYourFuture community to show respect and courtesy to each other.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in our Sunday classes, events and on digital platforms to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Expected Behavior

Part of the HackYourFuture community (hereinafter HYF community) are: every student, mentor, external partner and sta. This is what we expect:

- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be kind to others. Behave professionally. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
- Be careful in the words that you choose, both in direct and online communication. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Think twice before posting videos/pictures/jokes, and ask yourself if they could be offensive to someone in the community.
- Remind yourself that it’s not you who decides what’s offensive, it’s the person/group who’s offended and we ask you to respect this.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
  HackYourFuture Sta if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in
  distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem
  inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our Sunday classes, in the online community, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of HackYourFuture.

Harassment includes offensive, harmful or prejudicial verbal/electronic comments related to gender, personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

In the case of unacceptable behavior by a member of the community we will seek a dialogue with all parties involved in the conflict, open or anonymously. If no consensus can be reached we reserve the right to expel members from our community who do not comply with the Code Of Conduct.

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior
